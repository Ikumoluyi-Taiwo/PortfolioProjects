## About The Project.
This is a manipulated and made up dataset from Kaggle that reports road casualties in a particular location.

## Project Requirement.
The client wants to create a road accident dashboard for the years 2021 and 2022 so as to have some insights on the below requirements:
### Primary KPI: Total casualties and total accident values for current year and YOY growth.

### Primary KPIs: Total casualties by accident severity for current year and YOY growth.

### Secondary KPIs:
  Total casualties with respect to vehicle type for current year.
  
  Monthly trend showing comparison of casualties for current year and previous year.
  
  Casualties by road type for current year.
  
  Current year casualties casualties by Area/Location and by Day/Night.

  Total casualties and total accidents by location.

### Stakeholders 
  Organisations and Departments making use of this dashboard are:
  Ministry of Transport, Road Transport Department, Police Force, Emergency Services Department, Road Safety Corps, Transport Operators, Traffic Management Agencies,     Public, Media.
  
## Dataset. 
There is a raw Excel dataset provided with over 307,000 rows and 23 Columns.

## Skills Shown.
The dataset needed little cleaning but most of the challenges lay in the transformation process.

## Transformation and Data Modelling.
First off, the data was inspected to make sure there were no typographical errors. The data model consists of the 'Data' table which is the fact table and the 'Calendar' table which contained unique dates for the dataset. There was also a 'Calculations' table created that housed all calculated measures used in the data analysis.
In this dataset, typos were corrected as seen in this case: 
### In the Accident Severity column, 'Fatal' was misspelled as 'Fetal'

### This was corrected using Find and Replace.
